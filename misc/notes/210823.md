```ts
let refreshToken
let expiry
let isAuthed
const authCheck()
```

## authCheck
look for refresh token
if not found, or if server says !200,
request new token via user signIn
update signedIn boolean

store JWT in memory
(handled by supabase lib)

re-run authCheck before rendering:
+ chats
+ account settings

after JWT is received, update the expiry

## auto refresh token
fetch request, using cookie in headers
store response into refresh token
1 minute before expiry
